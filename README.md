## Project Overview  
This project focuses on **audio analysis and chord recognition** using deep learning. The code processes an **audio file (WAV format)**, extracts its features, and predicts corresponding chord music symbols. It also provides **visualizations** of the audio waveform, spectrogram, and predicted chords.

The model supports custom audio input, making it flexible for analyzing different types of audio files.

---

## Features  
- **Custom Audio Support**: Upload and analyze any WAV file.  
- **Chord Recognition**: Detect and display chord music symbols.  
- **Audio Visualization**: Generate visual representations such as waveform and spectrograms.  
- **Feature Extraction**: Use audio features like MFCCs, chroma, and spectral contrast for deep learning analysis.

## Installation  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GitaSathya/Chord-Spacelete.git
   cd Chord-Spacelete
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**  
   Make sure you have Python installed. Install the dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage  

1. **Run the Script**  
   ```bash
   python audio_analysis.ipynb
   ```

2. **Provide the Path to Your Custom Audio File**  
   The script will prompt you to enter the path of the audio file:  
   Example: `data/my_audio.wav`  

3. **View Results**  
   - Visualize the waveform and spectrogram.  
   - Predicted chord symbols will be displayed in the console.  

---

## Dependencies  
- **Python 3.8+**  
- **Librosa**: For audio analysis and feature extraction.  
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.  
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizations.  
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For deep learning model implementation.  

You can install all dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file.

---

## Code Workflow  

1. **Audio Loading and Preprocessing**  
   - Load the custom audio file.  
   - Extract features using `librosa` (e.g., MFCC, chroma, spectral contrast).  

2. **Model Prediction**  
   - The pre-trained deep learning model processes the audio features and predicts the corresponding chord symbols.  

3. **Visualization**  
   - Generate the waveform and spectrogram of the audio file.  
   - Display predicted chords in the console.
